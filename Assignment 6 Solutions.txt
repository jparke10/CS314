6-2:

a) Why instruction can or cannot be parallelized across loop iterations

Instructions in question:
mulss %xmm2, %xmm0
adds %xmm0, %xmm1

I believe these cannot be parallelized because of the fact that the
adds instruction requires the value in %xmm0 to be updated, and the
mulss instruction is actively changing that value. %xmm1 would not
have the correct answer contained in it if these were parallelized.

b) Lowest possible CPE for loop as currently written

We concluded that the add instructions cannot be parallelized, and
add takes 3 cycles + multiplication takes 5 cycles. There are 2 add
instructions and 1 mul instruction, giving us 11 cycles.
